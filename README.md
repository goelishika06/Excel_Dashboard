# Excel_Dashboard
I took a sample of product data which has attributes like item name, salesman, date, Quantity of items that salesman sold and prices of the item. Analysed this data through MS excel by using charts and pivot table.

# Dashboard Overview-
**Time-Series Navigation**: At the top, a Date Timeline slicer allows users to filter data across 2021 to 2023, enabling month-over-month or year-over-year comparisons.

**Categorical Filtering**: The Region and Item slicers provide granular control, allowing you to drill down into specific areas (like "East") or specific hardware (like "Speaker").

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Two prominent cards display high-level metrics: total Sales and total Quantity of specific item , providing an instant snapshot of overall health.

**Product Performance**: The Sale by Product bar chart highlights the volume for specific items; currently, it shows the "Speaker" has generated 18,300 in sales.

**Geographic Distribution**: The Sale by Region horizontal bar chart compares regional performance, identifying the "East" as the highest-performing territory at 9,300.

**Trend Analysis**: The Sale by Month line graph tracks seasonal fluctuations, showing for Example- Monitor sales peak in April (4500).

**Interactive Navigation**: On the left, navigation buttons (Dashboard, Product, Salesman) suggest a multi-page report structure for deeper analysis.

**Data Synchronicity:** All visuals are interconnected; selecting a filter in one slicer automatically updates every chart and KPI on the screen.

**Visual Hierarchy**: The layout uses color coding and clear labeling to ensure the most critical data points (KPIs) are noticed first.

**Actionable Insights:** By combining these views, stakeholders can quickly identify which products are driving revenue in which regions and at what time of year.
